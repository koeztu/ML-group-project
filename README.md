# ML-group-project


## things to talk about in summary

### preliminaries
- talk about composite features
- follow the notebook chronologically
- how did we choose features?
- how did we handle nans? (hint: there were none)
- feature engineering (agewhensold, agesinceremod, both very significant in random forest feature imporatnce)
- why databalancing is impossible for this dataset.
- impact of the seed for data shuffling / splitting
- (tomek links)

### MODEL COMPARISON 
- confusion matrices
- accuracy
- F1
